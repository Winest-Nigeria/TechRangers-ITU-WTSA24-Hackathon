USING AI TO REDUCE THE 6G STANDARDS BARRIER FOR AFRICAN CONTRIBUTORS
===
This repository contains the code for a Chatbot developed as part of ITU WTSA-24 Hackathon at India aimed at solving the digital divide between Africa and more advanced countries leveraging AI and 6G technology. The chatbot was designed to empower users by providing them with real-time assistance from ITU standard Knowledge base and information on accessing digital infrastructure, network technologies, and AI-driven solutions.

**Problem Statement**

Many regions in Africa face challenges accessing fast, reliable internet and modern technologies, contributing to a digital divide that limits access to opportunities. This chatbot aims to address the knowledge gap and infrastructure limitations by offering AI-driven insights and guidance on these issues.

**Solution Overview**

The chatbot leverages cutting-edge AI technologies to analyze the challenges unique to Africa and propose solutions or relevant information in 6G technology standard that can help bridge the gap between African countries and more technologically advanced nations.

**ITU Knowledge base**

1.	ITU-T Y.3061 – Framework for AI-native networks
2. ITU- Framework on autonomous systems
   
**Alignment with Sustainable Development Goals**

SDG 4 Quality Education

SDG 9 Information, Innovation and Infractructure

SDG 10 Reduced Inequality

**Key Features**

Real-time network issue analysis: Analyzes digital infrastructure and connectivity challenges.
Technology insights: Shares knowledge about 6G and its potential benefits for Africa.
Guidance on access: Provides users with ways to improve their access to digital resources.

**Frameworks and Technologies**

The chatbot was developed using a variety of powerful AI tools and frameworks:

Jupyter Notebook: For initial development and experimentation.
Flask: Python framework to create API to expose the chatbot to users.
Ngrok: Exposes the local Flask server to the internet for real-time testing and usage.
JarvisAI: Provides basic NLP capabilities and AI integrations.
LangChain: For building advanced LLM applications and managing the chatbot's conversational flows.
Hugging Face API: Access to pre-trained models and tokenizers.
Transformer Model: Implements the core logic of the chatbot.
Chrom and Chroma DB: Handles conversational data and session management.
Meta-LLaMA 2.7B: AI model used to fine-tune the chatbot’s ability to analyze network issues and provide technical advice.
Flutter: For developing the mobile app so users can interact with the chatbot.

PS: The source code to the mobile app is in the `winest_chatbot' branch in this project.

**How to Use**

Once running, you can interact with the chatbot through the mobile app interface exposed by Ngrok. The chatbot is ready to assist with digital divide issues and provide information on 6G technology andwith code generation and other related topics.

**Future Work**

Enhance chatbot capabilities by adding a code generation function.
Increase the database
Extend the scope to cover broader technological gaps between Africa and more advanced countries.
Increase GPU to a higher standard for a faster response
